# vmwrap
Hustle-free command line tool to invoke any command in a VM.

```
$ vmwrap uname -r
5.12.1-vmwrap
```

Spawns Linux VM (KVM/QEMU + the custom minimal 3MiB kernel) and invokes a command.

No need to setup a VM image â€” host filesystem is shared with the guest.
This is supposed to be mostly drop-in compatible:
current environment is passed to the command;
command runs in the current working directory;
vmwrap exits with the same status as the command.

# Building
It comes with a Dockerfile.
